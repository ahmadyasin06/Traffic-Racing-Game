 Traffic Racing Game ðŸŽ®ðŸš—  I proudly showcase my 2nd-semester GUI-based project, developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C#!  This project features a user-friendly interface and incorporates core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to deliver an engaging gameplay experience.  Working on this game helped me refine my programming skills and deepen my understanding of Graphic User Interface design and game mechanics.  Check out the attached video for a glimpse of the action! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. ðŸ˜Š
